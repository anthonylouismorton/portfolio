      "description": "My name my name is Anthony Morton. I am a full-stack web developer. I have a background in industrial hygiene, and I also have a bachelorâ€™s degree in occupational health and safety from Columbia Southern University. Before my time as an industrial hygienist, I served 9 years in the United States Marine Corps where I was a motor transport operator and an imagery analyst. My skills include leadership, teamwork, and adaptability. During my time in the Marines, I enjoyed being a leader and I found being a leader was most rewarding when I was able to help my subordinates advance their careers and get promoted. I also enjoyed using teamwork to build comradery and that comradery was one of my favorite parts of being a Marine. Currently, I am hoping to find a role in automation. I am particularly interested in automation that helps with worker safety. Engineering controls are one of the most efficient ways to keep a worker safe and one of the more effective engineering controls is the use of automation ",
